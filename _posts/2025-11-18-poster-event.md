The ELLIS Institute Tübingen, the Tübingen AI Center, the Cluster of Excellence “Machine Learning: New Perspectives for Science”, and TAPPA are pleased to invite you to the Tübingen AI Winter Poster Event 2025.

The event will showcase recent ML papers from Tübingen published in top-tier venues.
If your paper has been accepted since our previous event (July 2025), we warmly invite you to present your poster! Otherwise, feel free to join us to mingle, exchange ideas, and enjoy the afternoon with snacks and drinks in a festive, pre-holiday atmosphere.

🗓️ Thursday, December 18 @ 15:00-19:00
📍 MvL1 (Maria-von-Linden-Straße 1, Tübingen) - Top Floor
📝 Registration link: https://forms.gle/XP3E4d71nCFwY64F9

Note: Due to space limitations, we may need to limit the number of posters if registrations exceed capacity - so register early! And thank you for your understanding.

Best regards,
The Organizing Team
