<!-- ![](images/header.png) -->

TAPPA stands for *Tübingen AI PhD and Postdoc Assembly* and is a grassroots initiative to bring together
PhD students and Postdocs doing research in AI in Tübingen.
It is similar in spirit to a student council: the goal is to **enhance the PhD and Postdoc experience** within
the Tübingen AI ecosystem by addressing common concerns, organizing events, and more.

## TAPPA meetings
